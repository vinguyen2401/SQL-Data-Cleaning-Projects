# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Projects
## Project Overview
This project was conducted to both satisfy my curiosity and practice data analytics skills, particularly in SQL. With the surge of layoffs in tech and other sectors, I wanted to explore whether these layoffs were concentrated in specific countries or industries or spread globally.
## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle covers global layoffs from 2020 to 2022, across 55 countries and 27 industries. It includes nine columns detailing company name, location, industry, total and percentage of layoffs, date, funding stage, country, and funds raised in millions, offering insights into global layoff trends.
